# Student-Survey-Spend-Analysis-
In the United States, there are many stores in which a survey was
 conducted based on students i.e. how much they are spending on different kinds
 of purchases like Video games, Indoor games, Toys, Books, Gadgets, etc. In the
 data set (Student Survey), the Store setting is the column that explains the Type of
 location in which the store is present. By using a data set (Student Survey), try to
 extract meaningful insights.
 1. Tabular Visualization
To create a tabular visualization for the Total Amount of Purchase (TAP) based on 'Store location' and 'Store setting', organize the data accordingly. If any record equals 60000, format that specific record's color to blue. This enables easy identification of significant purchase amounts within the dataset.

2. Matrix Visualization
Develop a Matrix Visualization that captures the expenditure on Outdoor sports across various age groups and 'Store setting'. Ensure that color formatting is based on the total amount spent, enhancing the visual appeal and data readability, thus facilitating insights into spending patterns across age demographics.

3. Funnel Chart
Construct a Funnel Chart that illustrates the Total Purchase Amount by 'Store setting'. This chart should feature data labels reflecting the percentage of the first value, providing a clear representation of the purchasing behavior through each stage.

4. Pie Chart
Generate a Pie Chart that represents the total purchases categorized by different 'Store locations' specifically for the Suburban 'Store setting'. Implementing a filter context here ensures only the relevant data for the specified setting is visualized, allowing concentration on suburban sales.

5. Scatter Plot & Sand Dance Plot
a) Scatter Plot
Develop a Scatter Plot highlighting the relationship between Video games purchase and Outdoor sports spent across different ages. This visualization will offer insights into how spending varies among age groups for these categories.

b) Sand Dance Plot
Create a Sand Dance Plot to explore the spending on Indoor sports and Video games across various age groups. This visualization will facilitate observation of trends and interactions between spending behaviors effectively across demographics.

6. Data Access Restriction
Implement restrictions on data access based on the User mapping table. For instance, users like Mani, who works exclusively with Rural areas, should have access limited to datasets pertinent to Rural settings. This ensures data privacy and tailored user experiences.

7. Publishing and Dashboard Design
​Publish the completed report to the Power BI cloud service and design a Master Dashboard that showcases the Funnel chart alongside the scatter plots.​ Additionally, set up a scheduled refresh to run six times every 4 hours within a day, ensuring that the data remains current and actionable.

8. Q&A Feature Utilization
a) Average Age of Students
Use the Q&A feature in Power BI to query the average age of students in a natural language format. This interactive feature simplifies data exploration and enhances user engagement with the report.

b) Donut Chart
Leverage the Q&A capability to create a Donut chart that visualizes the total amount of purchases according to 'Store location'. This adds another layer of clarity to the purchasing data, facilitating more informed decision-making amidst varying store contexts.
